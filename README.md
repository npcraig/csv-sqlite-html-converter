## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Files not appearing in the processed list?**
- Check that files have .csv extension
- Ensure files are not empty or corrupted
- Try uploading files one at a time to identify problematic ones

**Can't see individual file preview?**
- Click the eye icon next to the file name
- Check that the file processed successfully (no error status)
- Try refreshing the page if previews aren't loading

**Combine button disabled?**
- Ensure at least one file is selected (checkbox checked)
- Check that files have been processed successfully
- Verify files appear in the processed files list

**File replacement not working?**
- Make sure the new file has exactly the same name as the original
- Check that the file is a valid CSV format
- The old file should be automatically replaced in the list

**Conversion failing?**
- Verify CSV format is valid for each file
- Check for unusual characters or encoding issues in individual files
- Try different delimiter settings
- Use individual file previews to identify problematic data

**Large file performance?**
- Process files individually to identify performance bottlenecks
- Use modern browser with sufficient RAM
- Close other browser tabs
- Consider splitting very large files

**Download not working?**
- Ensure at least one file is selected for combination
- Check browser download settings
- Ensure pop-ups are not blocked
- Try right-clicking and "Save As"

## üìà Performance Tips

- **Large Files**: Process files under 100MB for best performance
- **Memory Usage**: Close other applications when processing large datasets
- **Browser Choice**: Chrome and Firefox generally offer best performance
- **File Format**: SQLite files are typically much smaller than equivalent CSVs
